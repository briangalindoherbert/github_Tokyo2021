# github_Tokyo2021
I just (October 4, 2021) created a new repo to replace what I had started for my Tokyo Olympics analysis, prior work was very preliminary and bug-ridden! 

I've added analysis of athlete height and weight by sport and event, and comparisons between athlete mean and the distributions of US adults- 
    as well as just US adult men and women age 20-29 years, which matches the mean age of most Olympic athletes (age data also included).
    
    Also, in this latest version I got the html-scraping via Pandas and Beautiful Soup working much more reliably.  The Olympic site has a lot of idiosyncracies and lack of standard html tags, which would make pulling data easier.  I am not sure why they do not code the pages so they are more readily accessible, but it works!
    the batch loaded file data that I started with (I had started the app by using a publicly available file that seemed well circulated, but found it
    had errors so I wrote a 'true-up routine' to fix it from the results I scraped directly.  I learned from that- don't trust public data- it's ok to
    use it, but its best to work up a verification scheme to test and fix the data just in case :-).
    
    OK, rambling, I have another piece to add soon which is my grouping of sports by other dimensions- just a fun or creative way of looking at sports
    and the medal counts along different lines.  I will push my updates for that within the next week.  Its kind of a fun piece, a bit tongue-in-cheek,
    like finding alternate common threads between these 339 medal events and 48 sport disciplines.
    
    OK, that's all for now...
